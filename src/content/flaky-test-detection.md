# Introduction
As in any other professional field, we know the value of self-improvement. It not only helps us face the competition, but we also get to add value to our field of expertise. This is what inspired me to take the Microsoft certification exam. My journey is far from over as I still have at least two other exams to take. Anyway, this is my first post about my experience of the process and any tips I could share. Please note that as per the NDA we sign before taking the exam, I might not be able to give away a lot. This might be a good thing, so that, you get to experience a lot of it on your own.

## Why get a Microsoft Certification?
Goes without saying, Microsoft is already an established brand name in the field of Software Engineering. So being vouched by them for our skills is quite well received by peers, employers, recruiters and more. If my opinion doesn't sound convincing, Microsoft themselves provide a detailed page on [why get certified](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/certification-benefits.aspx).

## Finding the right certification
Microsoft has revamped its certification website to be [Microsoft Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/default.aspx). It has lots of information including the one we saw earlier 'Why get certified?' and more. 
The simplest way to find what certification suits you is to [browse all certifications](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/browse-all-certifications.aspx). There you can filter based on your needs.

Now that you know how to get to the list of available certifications, it is now up to you as to what to choose. Depending on what you are passionate about, or what your current/future role demands are, filter out and select your certification for further details.

# Conclusion
I managed to learn a lot more than Azure Fundamentals while taking the AZ-900 exam. Hoping this post helps others in preparation of a Microsoft exam. If you have any thoughts or comments please do get in touch with me on twitter [@rubberduckdev](https://twitter.com/rubberduckdev).
